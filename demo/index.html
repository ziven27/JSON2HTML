                <p>Dear fellow Daoists, I’m a new translator who started reading translated Chinese Novels about 1 year ago. As the number of novels I read increased, it was inevitable that I fell deeply in love with the genre. With time, I began to desire to have a piece of work of this genre under my name as well, for others to enjoy. Joining QI provided me with a large number of exciting novels to choose from, with the one I ultimately chose to settle down to being Fishing The Myriad Heavens.</p>
                <p>This is a very interesting book about a regular MC with regular problems living in modern China, but with a unique story-line. He comes across an incredible stroke of luck, allowing him to bring items and living things from other worlds into his own. The author was able to paint the myriad worlds skillfully with his pen and describe them in such a way that the readers can feel immersed in the fantasy world he crafted. He would also often construct funny situations not only for the MC, but also the characters in their different worlds.</p>
                <p>This little translator hereby would like to humbly beseech our kind readers to, like the author said, give this novel a try! Apart from simply translating the words, I will also be dedicating extra efforts into portraying the author’s original intended meaning in its complex phrases as accurately as possible while allowing the story to flow in its interesting manner.</p>

                    <p>Tired of the schemes and strifes of city life, Bei Feng finally returned to his hometown in the countryside.</p>
                    <p>While picking asters “neath the Eastern fence;</p>
                    <p>My gaze upon the Southern mountain rests;</p>
                    <p>Rearing a few chickens and ducks, I shall lead a simple and leisurely life!</p>
                    <p>However, who would have thought that fate would play a huge joke on Bei Feng? All kinds of magical items and beings of the Myriad Worlds could actually be fished out of the Ancient Well in his yard!</p>
                    <p>Even a chicken reeled out of the well ended up chasing Bei Feng all over the yard and beating him black and blue... speechless and aggrieved, he asked the Heavens: if, that day, I’d fished out a Dragon instead of a chicken, what would’ve happened to me?!</p>

                <p>Hello everyone, I am the author of Fishing The Myriad Heavens. First, I would like to thank Yuewen Group for providing me with such a huge platform to publish this novel.</p>
                <p>I would also like to express my appreciation for my editors. To have my work presented on an international platform like this, I’m truly honored. It is also a testament to the affirmation my editors have for my work.</p>
                <p>Music has no boundaries. Even though we cannot understand the language of a great number of songs, we continue to be touched by the music, and are able to understand the message and emotions within a song just based on its melody.</p>
                <p>I believe the same could be said about novels. If the boundary of language were to be torn down, a good story could still be enjoyed by all!</p>
                <p>This book contains many of the legends, mythologies and the quintessence of chinese culture that make up part of a compelling, page-turning story.</p>
                <p>I would like to take this chance to ask for everyone’s support, and hope that our readers will give this novel a try!</p>

            <div class="m-artical wrap">
                <p>Translating is the art of wooing a language, transforming one language gracefully into another language while keeping its original content and meaning intact.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your efforts to open up this amazing story in its entirety to our readers overseas.</p>
                <p>The dedication required to translate a long novel like this cannot be understated! Chinese culture is both wide-ranging and immensely deep. This novel has so many profound terms, words and expressions in it that even I feel a deep headache just thinking about someone else having to translate all of that into another language...</p>
                <p>I would like to sincerely thank the translators and editors for their hard work. You guys are the people who gave this novel a chance to be exposed to a larger audience, one made up of multiple races and nationalities.</p>
